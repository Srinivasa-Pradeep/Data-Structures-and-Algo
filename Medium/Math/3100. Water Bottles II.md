# [Water Bottles II](https://leetcode.com/problems/water-bottles-ii/description/) - Notes

**Problem Type:** Medium

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

You are given two integers `numBottles` and `numExchange`.

* `numBottles`: initial number of full water bottles.
* In one operation, you can:

  1. Drink any number of full bottles (they become empty).
  2. Exchange `numExchange` empty bottles for **1 full bottle**, then increment `numExchange` by 1.

⚠️ You **cannot** batch exchanges at the same value of `numExchange`.

Return the **maximum number of water bottles you can drink**.

---

## 🧩 Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: numBottles = 13, numExchange = 6
Output: 15
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numBottles = 10, numExchange = 3
Output: 13
```

---

## 🔒 Constraints

* `1 <= numBottles <= 100`
* `1 <= numExchange <= 100`

---

## 💡 Key Idea

* Start by drinking all bottles (`drank = numBottles`).
* Keep track of empty bottles.
* As long as empty ≥ `numExchange`, you can trade them for 1 new full bottle.
* After each trade:

  * `drank += 1` (since you drink that new bottle).
  * Empty bottles reduce by `(numExchange - 1)` (you spend `numExchange` but get back 1 after drinking).
  * Increment `numExchange` for the next trade.

---

## ✅ Code

```python
class Solution:
    def maxBottlesDrunk(self, numBottles: int, numExchange: int) -> int:
        drank = empty = numBottles
        while empty >= numExchange:
            drank += 1
            empty -= numExchange - 1
            numExchange += 1
        return drank
```

---

## 📝 Intuition Recap

* It’s a greedy simulation.
* Always exchange whenever possible.
* The tricky part: `numExchange` grows, so the next trade requires more empties.

Do you want me to also sketch out a **step-by-step dry run table** (like for Example 2 with `10, 3`) so you can feel the flow clearly?
