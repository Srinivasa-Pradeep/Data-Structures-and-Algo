### [Delete Nodes From Linked List Present in Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-nodes-from-linked-list-present-in-array/description/) - Notes

**Task:**
Given `nums` and the head of a linked list, delete every node whose value exists in `nums`.

---

### ðŸ§© Logic Flow

1. Convert `nums` â†’ **set** for O(1) lookups.
2. Move `head` forward while its value is in that set.
3. Start `curr = head`.
4. Walk the list:

   * If `curr.next.val` is in set â†’ skip that node.
   * Else â†’ move `curr` forward.
5. Return the cleaned `head`.

---

### ðŸ§  Why it works

You never need to rebuild the listâ€”just rewire `.next` pointers.
Skipping nodes means pointing around them, not deleting them.

---

### ðŸ•’ Complexity

* **Time:** O(n + m)
* **Space:** O(m)  (for the set)

---

### ðŸ§¾ Code

```python
class Solution:
    def modifiedList(self, nums: List[int], head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        bad = set(nums)
        while head and head.val in bad:
            head = head.next
        curr = head
        while curr and curr.next:
            if curr.next.val in bad:
                curr.next = curr.next.next
            else:
                curr = curr.next
        return head
```
