Got it, my genius 🤍 let’s add a **visual pointer diagram** section into the notes, so even if you forget later, you can just glance and remember how it works.

# 📘 Valid Triangle Number (LeetCode 611) – Notes

## 🔹 Problem

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of triplets that can form a valid triangle.
A triangle is valid if **sum of any two sides > third side**.

---

## 🔹 Key Idea

If we **sort** the array:

```
nums[0] <= nums[1] <= ... <= nums[n-1]
```

Then for a triplet `(a, b, c)` where `c` is the largest side:

```
a + b > c
```

is the only condition we need to check.

---

## 🔹 Why Start Loop from `k = 2`

* `k` is the index of the **largest side**.
* For `k = 0` → no numbers before it (can’t form a triangle).
* For `k = 1` → only one number before it (still can’t form a triangle).
* For `k = 2` → at least **two numbers before it** (finally possible).

👉 That’s why:

```python
for k in range(2, n):
```

---

## 🔹 Two-Pointer Method

For each `k`:

* Set `i = 0` and `j = k - 1`
* While `i < j`:

  * If `nums[i] + nums[j] > nums[k]`:

    * All pairs between `i` and `j` are valid → add `(j - i)` to count
    * Move `j -= 1`
  * Else:

    * Too small, move `i += 1`

## 🔹 Example Walkthrough (nums = [2,2,3,4])

Sorted: `[2, 2, 3, 4]`

### Step 1: k = 2 (nums[k] = 3)

```
i=0 (2)   j=1 (2)   k=2 (3)
2 + 2 > 3 ✅
Triangle: (2,2,3)
Count = 1
```

---

### Step 2: k = 3 (nums[k] = 4)

```
i=0 (2)   j=2 (3)   k=3 (4)
2 + 3 > 4 ✅
Triangles: (2,3,4), (2,3,4)
Count += (j - i) = 2
```

Move j → j=1

```
i=0 (2)   j=1 (2)   k=3 (4)
2 + 2 > 4 ❌
Move i → stop
```

Total Count = **3**

---

## 🔹 Visual Pointer Diagram

```
Round 1 (k=2):
[2] [2] [3] 4
 i    j    k
→ (2,2,3) valid

Round 2 (k=3):
[2] [2] [3] [4]
 i        j    k
→ (2,3,4) valid for i=0,1

Then:
[2] [2] [3] [4]
 i    j       k
→ (2,2,4) invalid
```

---

## 🔹 Complexity

* **Time:** `O(n^2)` (better than brute force `O(n^3)`)
* **Space:** `O(1)`

---

## ✅ Final Code

```python
def triangleNumber(nums):
    nums.sort()
    n = len(nums)
    count = 0
    
    for k in range(2, n):
        i, j = 0, k - 1
        while i < j:
            if nums[i] + nums[j] > nums[k]:
                count += j - i
                j -= 1
            else:
                i += 1
                
    return count
```

---

🤍 **Key takeaway:**

* Always fix the largest side (`nums[k]`).
* Use two pointers (`i` and `j`) to count how many smaller sides can pair up.
* `(j - i)` is the “magic shortcut” to add multiple triangles at once.

---

Da, do you want me to also include a **bigger example (like 5–6 numbers)** in this note, so you can see how it scales beyond 4 elements?
