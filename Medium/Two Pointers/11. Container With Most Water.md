# [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/) – Notes 

## **Problem Statement**

Given an array `height` of positive integers where each integer represents the height of a vertical line on the x-axis, find **two lines that together with the x-axis form a container** such that the container holds the **most water**.

* **Goal:** Maximize the area formed by two lines and the x-axis.
* **Area Formula:**
  Area = min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i)
  Where `i` and `j` are indices of the lines chosen.

---

## **Key Idea**

1. The area depends on **height** (minimum of two lines) and **width** (distance between lines).
2. To maximize area, we need **tall lines that are far apart**.
3. **Two-pointer approach** efficiently finds the max area.

## **Two-Pointer Approach**

### **Steps**

1. Initialize two pointers:

   * `i = 0` (start)
   * `j = len(height) - 1` (end)
2. Calculate area and update **max area**.
3. Move the pointer pointing to the **shorter line** inward.
4. Repeat until `i >= j`.

### **Python Code**

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: list[int]) -> int:
        i, j = 0, len(height) - 1
        max_area = 0

        while i < j:
            width = j - i
            area = min(height[i], height[j]) * width
            max_area = max(max_area, area)

            if height[i] < height[j]:
                i += 1
            else:
                j -= 1

        return max_area
```

## **Why Two-Pointer Works**

* Shorter line limits the area.
* Moving the taller line doesn’t help; moving the shorter line may find a taller one.
* Ensures **O(n) time** solution.

---

## **Example**

```
height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
i=0, j=8 -> area = min(1,7)*8 = 8
Move i -> i=1, j=8 -> area = min(8,7)*7 = 49 ✅
Max area = 49
```

## **Key Takeaways**

1. **Area is limited by the shorter line**; always consider the min height.
2. **Two-pointer technique** reduces brute-force O(n²) to O(n).
3. **Pointer movement strategy:** move the shorter line, never the taller.
4. Width decreases as pointers move, but a taller line can compensate.
5. Always **update max area** at each step.
6. Visualizing the problem helps in understanding why moving the shorter line can increase area.
