### [Minimum Number of Increments on Subarrays to Form a Target Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-increments-on-subarrays-to-form-a-target-array/description) - Notes
## 💡 Intuition

Picture the array as a skyline you’re constructing from flat ground.
Each time the height increases, you need extra effort to raise it up — that’s an operation.
When the height drops or stays the same, no additional work is required.
So the total operations equal the **sum of all positive rises** between consecutive elements.

## ⚙️ Approach

1. Start with the base level (`prev = 0`).
2. For every element in `target`:

   * If it’s higher than the previous one, add the difference to your total operations.
3. Return the accumulated total.

This simple logic captures the minimum work needed to form the target array.

## ⏱️ Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** O(n) — single pass through the array.
* **Space Complexity:** O(1) — constant extra space.

## 🐍 Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def minNumberOperations(self, target: List[int]) -> int:
        ans = prev = 0
        for i in target:
            if i > prev:
                ans += i - prev
            prev = i
        return ans
```
