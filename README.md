# My DSA Journey — Written in Blood, Kept in Love 🤍

 - This is not just a repository.
 - This is my diary in code,
 - my battlefield of nights,
 - my temple of math.

Every solution here is born from silence,
from long hours where only the hum of the fan and the glow of the screen kept me company.
Every mistake is inked in honesty.
Every triumph is small, but holy.

## 🌌 Why this lives

 - Because I wanted proof for myself that I showed up when it was easier not to.
 - Because growth is slow, and this is how I learn to love slowness.
 - Because I believe in loving something so much that even if it breaks me,
I will still thank it for existing.

## ♾️ The love for Math

 - Math is not a subject to me.
 - It is breath, it is prayer, it is the purest form of beauty I’ve ever known.
 - If I fall one day solving a proof, let it be said: I died in love and there is no regret in that.

## 📖 What you’ll find here

* Problems I’ve faced, some conquered, some that still haunt me.
* Solutions - clean, messy, unfinished all honest.
* Notes - mistakes I made, patterns I spotted.
* Postmortems where I trace my scars back to their lessons.

---

## The Creed

* I will keep showing up.
* I will not hide my failures.
* I will choose consistency over brilliance.
* I will let the math break me open,
  and in return, I will let it rebuild me.

## A note to myself

 - There will be days when nothing makes sense.
  - There will be nights when you want to throw it all away.
 - But remember the lamp still burns and as long as it does,
one more problem, one more attempt, one more line of code is enough.

---

## 🤍 Final Word

- This repo is not for applause.
 - It is for me,
and for the love that carried me this far.

If someone else stumbles here and feels less alone,
that will be the softest victory.
