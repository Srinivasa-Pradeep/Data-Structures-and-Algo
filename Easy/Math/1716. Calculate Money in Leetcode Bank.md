###  [**Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank**](https://leetcode.com/problems/calculate-money-in-leetcode-bank/description/)- Notes

**Problem statement:**
Hercy deposits money daily in a bank.

* On the first Monday, he deposits $1.
* Each following day (Tue–Sun), he deposits $1 more than the previous day.
* Every new Monday, the starting deposit increases by $1 compared to the previous Monday.
  Find the total money saved after **n** days.

---

**Intuition:**

* Each week forms an arithmetic sequence of 7 terms, starting from that week’s Monday value.
* We compute:

  * `w = n // 7` → full weeks
  * `r = n % 7` → remaining days
* Total = sum of all full weeks + sum of leftover days.

**Code (Python):**

```python
class Solution:
    def totalMoney(self, n: int) -> int:
        w = n // 7
        r = n % 7
        total = 7 * (w * (w + 1) // 2 + 3 * w)
        total += r * (2 * w + r + 1) // 2
        return total
```

**Time Complexity:** O(1)
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

**Key Learning:**

* Identify repeating weekly patterns and model them as arithmetic progressions.
* Combine math formulas to avoid loops and achieve O(1) efficiency.
