# [812. Largest Triangle Area](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-triangle-area/description/) - Notes

## Problem
Given an array of points on the X-Y plane `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`, return the **area of the largest triangle** that can be formed by any three different points. Answers within `10^-5` of the actual answer are accepted.

### Examples
**Example 1:**
```python
points = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]]
# Output: 2.0
````

**Example 2:**

```python
points = [[1,0],[0,0],[0,1]]
# Output: 0.5
```

### Constraints

* `3 <= points.length <= 50`
* `-50 <= xi, yi <= 50`
* All points are **unique**

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Brute-force approach:**

   * Generate all combinations of 3 points (`nC3`) → feasible since `n <= 50`.
   * Compute the area for each triple.
   * Keep track of the maximum area.

2. **How combinations work:**

   * `itertools.combinations(points, 3)` generates **all possible groups of 3 points** from the array.
   * Order does **not matter** (triangle ABC is same as BAC).
   * If `points` has `n` elements, number of triples generated = `n! / (3!(n-3)!)`.

3. **Area Calculation:**

   * **Shoelace formula** (fast and precise):
     Area=0.5×∣x1​(y2​−y3​)+x2​(y3​−y1​)+x3​(y1​−y2​)∣

4. **Optimization ideas:**

   * Largest triangle vertices lie on the **convex hull**.
   * For larger datasets, reduce candidate points to hull points.
   * Optional: **rotating calipers** can find the max area in `O(m²)` where `m` = hull points.

5. **Python One-Liner:**

```python
from itertools import combinations
class Solution:
    def largestTriangleArea(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> float:
        return max(abs(x1*(y2-y3) + x2*(y3-y1) + x3*(y1-y2))/2 for (x1,y1),(x2,y2),(x3,y3) in combinations(points, 3))
```

6. **Why this works here:**

   * `n <= 50` → `O(n³)` is fast enough.
   * Coordinates small → precision safe.
   * All points unique → no degenerate triangles from duplicates.

---

## Notes

* For small `n`, brute-force is clean and sufficient.
* For larger `n`, consider convex hull + rotating calipers for efficiency.
* Shoelace formula is preferred over Heron's formula to avoid unnecessary square roots and floating-point errors.
* Using `combinations` ensures we **systematically check every possible triangle** without repetition.
