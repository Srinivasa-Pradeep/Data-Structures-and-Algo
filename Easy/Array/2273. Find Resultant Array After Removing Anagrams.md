### 🧩 Find Resultant Array After Removing Anagrams - Notes

**Goal:**
Given a list of words, repeatedly remove words that are *anagrams* of their previous adjacent word until no such pairs remain.

---

### ✅ Code

```python
class Solution:
    def removeAnagrams(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        res = [words[0]]
        for i in range(1, len(words)):
            if sorted(words[i - 1]) == sorted(words[i]):
                continue
            res.append(words[i])
        return res
```

### 🧠 Explanation

* **`sorted(word)`** → rearranges the letters alphabetically (e.g., `"baba"` → `['a','a','b','b']`).
* Two consecutive words are **anagrams** if their sorted forms are equal.
* If they are anagrams, we **skip** adding the current word.
* Otherwise, we **append** it to the result list.
* The first word is always included since there’s nothing before it.

### 🧾 Example

Input:

```python
["abba", "baba", "bbaa", "cd", "cd"]
```

Steps:

1. Start: `res = ["abba"]`
2. `"baba"` is an anagram of `"abba"` → skip
3. `"bbaa"` is an anagram of `"baba"` → skip
4. `"cd"` is not an anagram → add `"cd"`
5. Next `"cd"` is same as previous → skip

Output:

```python
["abba", "cd"]
```

### ⏱️ Time Complexity

* **Sorting each word:** `O(k log k)` where `k` = average length of each word.
* **Checking all pairs:** `O(n * k log k)` where `n` = number of words.

Overall → **O(n * k log k)**

---

### 💾 Space Complexity

* **`sorted()`** creates temporary arrays → `O(k)` per word.
* **Result list (`res`)** → up to `O(n)` in size.

Overall → **O(n + k)**
