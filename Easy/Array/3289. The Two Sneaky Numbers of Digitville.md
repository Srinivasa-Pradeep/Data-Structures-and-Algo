### [The Two Sneaky Numbers of Digitville](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-two-sneaky-numbers-of-digitville/description/) - Notes

# Intuition

In the town of **Digitville**, every number from `0` to `n-1` has its own place.
But two mischievous numbers decided to appear **twice**, disturbing the order.
Our goal is to find these two sneaky numbers by tracking how many times each number shows up.

---

# Approach

We’ll use a **hash map (dictionary)** to count occurrences of each number.

* As we traverse through the list, we update the count for each number.
* If a number’s count becomes `2`, that means we’ve found a duplicate — add it to the result.
* In the end, return both duplicated numbers.

This ensures we can detect both sneaky numbers efficiently in one scan.

# Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` — single traversal through the list.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` — storing frequency counts in a hash map.

# Code

### 🐍 Python 3

```python
class Solution:
    def getSneakyNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        freq = {}
        res = []
        for num in nums:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
            if freq[num] == 2:
                res.append(num)
        return res
```
