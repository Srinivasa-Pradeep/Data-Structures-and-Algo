# Maximum Frequency Elements – Brain Squeeze Session

## Problem Summary
Given an array `nums` of positive integers, return the **total frequencies** of elements that have the **maximum frequency** in the array.

**Example 1:**
```

Input: [1,2,2,3,1,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: 1 and 2 appear 2 times each (max frequency), total = 2+2 = 4

```

**Example 2:**
```

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: All elements appear once (max frequency = 1), total = 1+1+1+1+1 = 5

## Step-by-Step Thinking

1. **Count each element**  
   - Use a mental or real `Counter` to get `{element: frequency}`.
   - Example: `[1,2,2,3,1,4]` → `{1:2, 2:2, 3:1, 4:1}`

2. **Find the maximum frequency**  
   - Look at all counts and pick the largest one.
   - Example: `max([2,2,1,1]) = 2`

3. **Filter elements with max frequency**  
   - Only consider elements that appear `max_freq` times.
   - Example: elements 1 and 2 pass the filter.

4. **Sum their occurrences**  
   - Add the frequencies of elements hitting the max.
   - Example: `2 + 2 = 4`

## Mental Examples

- `[7,7,8,9,9,9]` → counts `{7:2, 8:1, 9:3}` → max = 3 → total frequency = 3  
- `[7,7,8,9,9]` → counts `{7:2, 8:1, 9:2}` → max = 2 → total frequency = 2 + 2 = 4  
- `[5,5,5,2,2,3]` → counts `{5:3, 2:2, 3:1}` → max = 3 → total frequency = 3  

---

## Logical Steps (Translated to Code Blocks)

1. **Counting with Counter:**
```python
from collections import Counter
counts = Counter(nums)
````

2. **Find maximum frequency:**

```python
max_freq = max(counts.values())
```

3. **Filter and sum frequencies:**

```python
total = sum(freq for freq in counts.values() if freq == max_freq)
```

4. **Return result:**

```python
return total
```

## One-Liner Approaches

### Basic one-liner (double Counter)

```python
return sum(v for v in Counter(nums).values() if v == max(Counter(nums).values()))
```

### Optimized one-liner (single Counter)

```python
c = Counter(nums); return sum(v for v in c.values() if v == max(c.values()))
```

### Semantic tweak (using `freq` instead of `v`)

```python
c = Counter(nums); return sum(freq for freq in c.values() if freq == max(c.values()))
```

## Key Insights / Brain Squeezes

* `Counter` gives a direct way to map **element → frequency**.
* `max` on `Counter.values()` finds the **highest frequency** quickly.
* Iterating and summing filtered frequencies gives the **total of max-frequency elements**.
* Placeholder names like `v` can be replaced with semantic names (`freq`) for clarity.
